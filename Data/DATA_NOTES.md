# MS4 Regulated Areas

## CB_MS4_Areas (Shapefile)
Polygons from the source data that intersect with the Casco Bay watershed 
were selected in GIS and exported as a separate shapefile for display.  
That includes both the Portland and Lewiston-Auburn Urbanized Areas.  
The Lewiston-Auburn urbanized area lies almost entirely outside the Casco 
Bay watershed.

No metadata was provided with the DEP data. It appears that the data was
derived from census data identifying urbanized areas, coded by a UA number 
and a name.
